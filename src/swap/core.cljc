(ns swap.core
  "Provider-agnostic swap core: an intent, a normalized quote, an execution plan
  as DATA, and the safety invariants that must hold before anything is signed.

  NOTHING HERE SIGNS OR SENDS. `plan` returns an ordered vector of steps
  (`:erc20-approve`, `:evm-call`, `:native-transfer`) that an executor — holding
  the keys, which this namespace never sees — carries out. That is the
  `state + event -> next-state + effects` shape this workspace uses for
  application logic (ADR-2607201300): product semantics live in portable data,
  and the mechanism of actually moving funds lives in a host.

  It also means the interesting half is testable without a network, a key, or a
  chain: a plan is a value you can assert on.

  TWO RAILS, ONE SHAPE:
    :aggregator — same-chain EVM swap via a DEX aggregator (`swap.aggregator`)
    :thorchain  — native cross-chain, e.g. BTC <-> ETH (`swap.thorchain`)
  Both produce the same normalized quote and the same kind of plan, so a caller
  picks a rail by asset pair and doesn't branch on vendor shapes."

(defn check
  "Validate a normalized quote against the intent BEFORE anything is signed.
  Returns `{:ok? true}` or `{:ok? false :problems [{…}]}` — every problem at
  once, as data, so a UI can show all of them instead of the first.

  These are the checks whose absence is expensive:

  - **min-out present and non-zero.** A swap submitted without a minimum-output
    guard can be sandwiched for an arbitrary fraction of its value. A provider
    that returns no min-out is not usable, not a warning.
  - **min-out consistent with the requested slippage.** If the provider's
    min-out is further below expected-out than the caller asked to tolerate,
    the caller's slippage setting is not being honoured.
  - **the fee is actually encoded.** If a fee was requested and the quote came
    back with `:fee-mechanism :none`, the swap earns nothing. Silent, and only
    discovered when the money doesn't arrive.
  - **not expired.** Requires `now` to be passed in — this namespace never reads
    a clock, so the same quote+time pair always yields the same verdict
    (`Date.now()` is also unavailable to workflow-style callers here).
  - **steps present.** A plan with no steps would \"succeed\" doing nothing.
  - **the fee recipient exists on the chain it will be paid on.** Checked when the
    intent declares `:fee-recipient-contract? true`. A Safe is deployed PER CHAIN,
    and a fee paid to an address with no code there cannot be moved by anyone —
    measured on a real Safe that existed on Ethereum and had no code on six other
    chains. Declared-but-unchecked is itself a problem, so a caller cannot forget
    to look.

  `facts` is an optional map of things this namespace cannot look up, because it
  performs no I/O: currently `{:fee-recipient-code <eth_getCode result>}`, obtained
  via `swap.fee/recipient-code-request`."
