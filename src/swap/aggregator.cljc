  "Same-chain EVM rail: a DEX aggregator driver.

  WHY AN AGGREGATOR AND NOT A ROUTER: quoting a swap well means splitting it
  across pools, comparing venues, and re-checking every block. An aggregator
  already does that, AND it exposes a fee parameter that skims our basis points
  on-chain to a recipient we name — so there is no fee contract to write, deploy,
  audit, or custody funds in. This is what MetaMask does; it is not a shortcut.

  VENDOR MAPPING IS DATA, NOT CODE. Aggregator APIs rename fields between
  versions, so an adapter is a map: which query parameters carry the fee, and
  where in the response the transaction, the expected output and the minimum
  output live. Correcting a vendor change is a one-line data edit, and the plan
  builder below is tested against fixtures rather than against a live vendor.

  STATUS OF THE SHIPPED ADAPTERS — the difference a live call makes:

    :lifi        LIVE-VERIFIED 2026-07-26 against li.quest (keyless). The first
                 live call FAILED, and found two real defects the fixtures could
                 not: `toChain` is a REQUIRED parameter and was missing, and `fee`
                 is a decimal FRACTION (0.02 = 2%), not basis points — sending
                 bps there would have been rejected as out of range, or silently
                 meant something else entirely. Both fixed; see `:fee-unit`.
    :zero-ex-v2  DOCS-VERIFIED, NOT live-verified. Parameter names, the bps unit
                 of `swapFeeBps` (0–1000), the `issues.allowance` semantics and
                 the `0x-version: v2` header are confirmed against 0x's current
                 published documentation, but 0x requires an API key and this repo
                 has none, so no live call has exercised the RESPONSE field paths.
                 Stays `:verified? false` until a real key produces a real quote.

  The LI.FI result is the argument for why `:verified?` is a field and not a
  comment: two of its parameters were wrong in a way no amount of fixture testing
  would have caught, because fixtures encode what the author believed the vendor
  wanted. So the flag is ENFORCED — `adapter` refuses an unverified one unless the
  caller opts in explicitly, rather than trusting that someone read this docstring.

  Current position (owner decision 2026-07-26): **LI.FI only**. 0x is deferred, not
  abandoned — the mapping stays, ready for one live call once a key exists.

  `parse-quote` fails loudly with the adapter's own path when a field is missing,
  rather than returning a quote with a nil min-out (which `swap.core/check` would
  then reject as unsafe anyway)."
  (:require [clojure.string :as str]
            [erc20.core :as erc20]
            [swap.core :as core]
            [swap.fee :as fee]))

(def adapters
  "Declarative vendor adapters. `:params` / `:fee-params` map our concepts onto
  the vendor's query parameters; `:paths` maps normalized quote fields onto paths
  into the vendor's response body (string keys, as JSON decodes).

  `:fee-unit` and `:slippage-unit` are load-bearing and NOT cosmetic: 0x wants
  basis points while LI.FI wants a decimal fraction, so the same 30 bps is `30`
  for one vendor and `0.003` for the other, and 100 bps of slippage is `100` vs
  `0.01`. Getting it wrong is either a rejected request or — worse — a value three
  orders of magnitude off. Both of LI.FI's units were wrong here until a live call
  said so, one after the other.

  `:cross-chain?` says whether the vendor can settle across chains at all. It is
  per-adapter and not per-rail because the two shipped adapters genuinely differ:
  LI.FI is a bridge aggregator over 72 chains, 0x's Swap API settles on one.

  `:fee-recipient-kind` says what the recipient parameter actually IS: an on-chain
  ADDRESS for 0x, but a registered INTEGRATOR ID for LI.FI, whose payout wallet is
  configured out-of-band in their partner portal rather than passed per request.
  Passing an address where an integrator id belongs looks like it works."
