(ns swap.chains
  "Chain and token metadata, so callers stop hand-constructing the `{:chain
  :chain-id :asset :symbol :decimals :address}` maps `swap.core/intent` wants.

  WHY A REGISTRY IS A SAFETY FEATURE AND NOT A CONVENIENCE: those maps carry a
  token's contract address and its decimals. A wrong address sends funds to a
  different token; a wrong `:decimals` mis-scales every amount by a power of ten.
  Both are silent. Hand-typing them per call site is the highest-risk thing a
  caller of this library does.

  EVERY VALUE HERE WAS VERIFIED FROM TWO INDEPENDENT SOURCES (2026-07-26):

  1. LI.FI's own token API (`/v1/tokens`) supplied the candidate addresses and
     decimals — the vendor we actually route through, not a memory of a docs page.
  2. Each address was then confirmed ON-CHAIN by calling `symbol()`, `decimals()`
     and `name()` through `erc20`'s own calldata and decoders against the deployed
     contract. 7/7 matched.

  That second step earned its keep immediately: **BSC's USDC has 18 decimals, not
  the 6 that USDC has on every other chain here.** Assuming 6 would have
  mis-scaled every BSC amount by 10^12 — the kind of error that produces a
  successful-looking transaction for a thousand times the intended value.

  THORChain halt state is deliberately NOT recorded here. It changes (BSC, BASE and
  SOL were all halted when this was written) and a stale flag is worse than none —
  read it at runtime from `thorchain.quote/parse-inbound-addresses` and
  `chain-sendable?`."
