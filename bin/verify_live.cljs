;; LIVE verification of the swap plane against REAL networks and a REAL chain.
;; Keyless throughout: public LI.FI, public Ethereum mainnet RPC, public Sepolia
;; RPC. Read-only except for one deliberately-unfunded Sepolia broadcast (part 5).
;;
;; NOT part of CI, on purpose: CI must not go red because a third party is down.
;; This is the check you run when you change an adapter, and the one that earns an
;; adapter its `:verified? true`.

;;
;; Everything here runs the ACTUAL library code — the point is not "can we curl an
;; API" but "does erc20/org-thorchain/swap agree with a real chain and a real node".
;;
;; WHAT THIS FOUND on its first run (2026-07-26), none of which fixture tests
;; could have caught, because a fixture encodes what the author believed:
;;   1. LI.FI requires `toChain`; the adapter never sent it            -> 400
;;   2. LI.FI's `fee` is a decimal FRACTION, not basis points          -> 400
;;   3. LI.FI's `slippage` is a fraction too                           -> 400
;;   4. `at` with a nil field path returned the WHOLE response body, so an
;;      adapter with no allowance paths (LI.FI) built a bogus approve step and
;;      threw on a map where an address belonged
;; That is the argument for live-verifying a vendor mapping before trusting it
;; with money.
