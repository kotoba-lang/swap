# swap

[![CI](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/swap/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/swap/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

**Provider-agnostic swap core: an intent, a normalized quote, an execution plan
as data, the safety checks that must pass before anything is signed, and fee
accounting. Two rails reduced to one shape.**

The orchestration layer of the kotoba-lang swap plane (ADR-2607261500).

```

## Nothing here signs or sends

`plan` returns an ordered vector of steps. An executor — which holds the keys,
and which this library never sees — carries them out and feeds outcomes back as
events.

```clojure
{:step/kind :erc20-approve
 :step/why  "the router (0xdef1…) needs an allowance for 1.5 USDC"
 :chain "ETH" :to <token> :data "0x095ea7b3…" :value "0"}

{:step/kind :native-transfer
 :step/why  "send 0.05 BTC to the THORChain vault to receive at least … of ETH.ETH;
             0.3% affiliate fee to kb is skimmed on-chain by the network"
 :chain "BTC" :to "bc1q…" :amount "5000000" :memo "=:ETH.ETH:0x…:2000…/1/0:kb:30"}
```

`:step/why` is required on every step. A wallet that can't explain a confirmation
prompt in the user's own units shouldn't be asking for one.

This is the `state + event -> next-state + effects` shape this workspace uses for
application logic (ADR-2607201300): product semantics in portable data, mechanism
in a host. The practical payoff is that the entire interesting half — routing,
fee encoding, slippage guards, sequencing — is testable **without a network, a
key, or a chain**. A plan is a value you can assert on.

## What it refuses to do

The core exists to say no. `check` returns *every* problem at once as data, so a
UI can show all of them rather than the first:

| refusal | why it matters |
|---|---|
| `:missing-min-out` | A swap with no minimum-output guard can be sandwiched for an arbitrary fraction of its value. A provider that returns no min-out is unusable, not a warning. |
| `:zero-min-out` | min-out of 0 accepts any output, including ~nothing. |
| `:min-out-below-requested-slippage` | The provider's guard is looser than the tolerance the caller asked for — i.e. the setting isn't being honoured. |
| `:fee-not-encoded` | A fee was requested and the quote came back carrying none. The swap looks fee-bearing and **earns nothing**. Silent, and only discovered when the money doesn't arrive. |
| `:fee-bps-mismatch` | Encoded bps ≠ requested bps, in either direction. |
| `:quote-expired` | Requires `now` to be passed in — this library never reads a clock, so the same (quote, time) always gives the same verdict. |
| `:no-steps` | An empty plan would "succeed" having done nothing. |

`intent` refuses earlier still: a float amount (a `uint256` doesn't fit in a
double), a missing `:decimals` (which would silently mis-scale every amount), a
`:fee-bps` without a `:fee-recipient` (a fee charged and paid to nobody), and any
fee above 1000 bps.

## Taking a fee: three mechanisms, in preference order

This is the commercial question, so `swap.fee` states the trade-offs rather than
implying them by whichever got built first.

1. **`:protocol-affiliate` — use this.** The aggregator or cross-chain network
   skims the fee **on-chain** and pays a recipient you name, as part of the swap
   (0x's `swapFeeRecipient`/`swapFeeBps`, THORChain's affiliate memo field). One
   transaction, no custody, no contract to deploy or audit. **MetaMask's own
   0.875% works exactly this way** — embedded in the quote, not a second
   transfer. (The gas the user pays goes to validators, not to MetaMask.)
2. **`:separate-transfer`** — swap, then transfer the fee separately. Trivial and
   universally available, but it doubles gas and the two transactions aren't
   atomic: the swap can land and the fee transfer fail, leaving the books and the
   chain disagreeing. Supported because some providers offer nothing better;
   never a default.
3. **A custom fee-router contract** — atomic and fully controlled, and also a new
   contract custodying third-party funds: an audit, a deployment key, an upgrade
   story, a permanent liability. `kotoba-lang/engi-witness-escrow` is this
   workspace's only Solidity precedent and is explicitly local-test-only. **Not
   implemented here, on purpose.**

Fees are booked through `kotoba-lang/treasury` — pending on submission,
confirmed only after the transaction confirms on-chain. A fee booked before
confirmation is a fee that can be booked and never received.

### The fee recipient has to exist on the chain the fee lands on

**A Safe is a contract, deployed per chain.** An address being unoccupied on another
chain does not mean your Safe is there, and a fee paid to an address with no code on
that chain cannot be moved by anyone, ever.

This is measured, not theoretical. A real Safe: deployed on Ethereum mainnet
(v1.4.1), and `eth_getCode` returns `0x` on **BSC, Avalanche, Base, Polygon,
Arbitrum and Optimism**. `treasury` was at the time advising exactly the switch that
would have burned it — *"a Safe's address is the same across chains, so switching
chain moves the rail to a cheaper L2 without changing the recipient."*

So declare it and `check` enforces it:

```clojure
(def i (core/intent {… :fee-bps 30 :fee-recipient safe
                     :fee-recipient-contract? true}))   ; ← declare, don't guess

(fee/recipient-code-request i)      ;=> an eth_getCode request, as data
(core/check i quote now {:fee-recipient-code code})
;; on Ethereum -> {:ok? true}
;; on Base     -> {:ok? false :problems [{:problem :fee-recipient-has-no-code …}]}
;; no code supplied at all -> {:problem :fee-recipient-unverified …}
```

Three deliberate details:

- **`:fee-recipient-contract?` is declared, never inferred.** An EOA legitimately has
  no code, so "no code here" is ambiguous between *fine* and *funds lost* unless the
  caller says which kind of recipient it is.
- **Declared-but-unchecked is its own problem.** A caller must not be able to forget
  to look; silence is not a pass.
- **Not declaring anything keeps the previous behaviour**, so existing callers are
  unaffected.

Verified live (`bin/verify_live.cljs` part 6) against that same Safe on both a chain
where it exists and one where it does not — including the positive case, because the
first version of that check read `nil` on both chains and the negative assertion
passed *by accident*.

## Chains and tokens: `swap.chains`

A registry, and it is a **safety feature rather than a convenience**. The side maps
`intent` takes carry a token's contract address and its decimals: a wrong address
sends funds to a different token, wrong decimals mis-scale every amount by a power
of ten, and both are silent. Hand-typing them per call site is the riskiest thing a
caller does.

```clojure
(chains/native :bitcoin)      ;=> {:chain "BTC" :symbol "BTC" :decimals 8 :asset "BTC.BTC"}
(chains/token :bsc :usdc)     ;=> {:chain "BSC" :chain-id 56 :symbol "USDC" :decimals 18 …}
(chains/on-rail :thorchain)   ;=> (:avalanche :base :bitcoin :bitcoin-cash :bsc :dogecoin
                              ;    :ethereum :litecoin)
(chains/spendable? :bitcoin-cash) ;=> false — swap INTO only, see below
```

**Every value was verified from two independent sources** (2026-07-26): LI.FI's own
token API supplied the candidates, then each address was confirmed **on-chain** by
calling `symbol()`/`decimals()`/`name()` through `erc20`'s calldata against the
deployed contract. 7/7 matched — and that second step earned its keep immediately:

> **BSC's USDC has 18 decimals, not the 6 it has on every other chain.** Assuming 6
> would have mis-scaled every BSC amount by 10¹² — a successful-looking transaction
> for a thousand times the intended value.

THORChain halt state is deliberately **not** in the registry. It changes (BSC, BASE
and SOL were all halted when this was written) and a stale flag is worse than none —
read it at runtime via `thorchain.quote/chain-sendable?`.

`:bitcoin-cash` is marked `:spendable? false`: `btc-crypto` can derive a BCH receive
address but cannot sign for BCH (it needs `SIGHASH_FORKID`), so BCH is swap-into
only. Stated as data so a caller can branch on it rather than discover it.

## Rail 1 — same-chain EVM… and cross-chain (`swap.aggregator`)

Quoting a swap well means splitting across pools, comparing venues, and
re-checking every block. An aggregator already does that *and* exposes the fee
parameter above.

**Vendor mapping is data, not code.** An adapter is a map of which query
parameters carry the fee and where the transaction / expected-out / min-out live
in the response. A vendor rename is a one-line edit.

`:fee-unit` and `:slippage-unit` are part of that data and are **not** cosmetic:
0x wants basis points, LI.FI wants a decimal fraction. The same 30 bps is `30` for
one and `0.003` for the other. `:fee-recipient-kind` likewise records that 0x's
recipient is an on-chain **address** while LI.FI's is a registered **integrator
ID** whose payout wallet is configured out-of-band.

### Adapter status, and what a live call bought

**Current position: LI.FI only** (owner decision 2026-07-26). 0x is deferred, not
abandoned — its mapping stays, ready for one live call once a key exists.

That decision is **enforced, not remembered**: `agg/adapter` defaults to `:lifi`
and *refuses* an unverified adapter unless you opt in with
`{:allow-unverified? true}`.

```clojure
(agg/adapter)                                     ;=> the :lifi adapter
(agg/adapter :zero-ex-v2)                         ;=> throws — never live-verified
(agg/adapter :zero-ex-v2 {:allow-unverified? true}) ;=> allowed, deliberately
```

After a live call found four defects in a mapping written carefully from the
vendor's own docs, an unverified mapping is not a smaller risk than an untested
one — it is the same risk wearing documentation. So the flag is a gate rather than
a note somebody is supposed to have read.

| adapter | status |
|---|---|
| `:lifi` | **live-verified** 2026-07-26 against `li.quest`, keyless — and the default |
| `:zero-ex-v2` | **docs-verified only.** Parameter names, `swapFeeBps`'s bps unit (0–1000), `issues.allowance` semantics and the `0x-version: v2` header are confirmed against 0x's current docs, but 0x needs an API key and this repo has none — so no live call has exercised the **response** field paths. `:verified? false` until one does. |

The first live LI.FI call **failed**, and found four real defects that fixtures
could not — because a fixture encodes what the author *believed* the vendor wanted:

1. `toChain` is a **required** parameter and the adapter never sent it → `400`.
2. `fee` is a decimal **fraction** (`0.02` = 2%), not basis points → `400`.
3. `slippage` is a fraction too → `400`.
4. `at` with a `nil` field path returned the **whole response body**, so an adapter
   declaring no allowance paths (LI.FI) got the entire response as its `spender`,
   made `needs-approve?` true, and threw encoding a map as an address.

That is why `:verified?` is a field rather than a comment, and why the normalized
quote surfaces `:verified-adapter?` so a caller cannot miss it. `parse-quote` also
**fails loudly** naming the exact missing path rather than returning a quote with a
nil min-out.

Re-run it after touching an adapter (**not** in CI — CI must not go red because a
third party is down):

```bash
nbb --classpath "$(clojure -Spath -M:test | tr ':' '\n' \
     | grep -E 'kotoba-lang|^src$' | tr '\n' ':')" bin/verify_live.cljs
```

**Cross-chain is a per-adapter capability, not a rail-wide ban.** This used to be a
blanket *"the aggregator rail is same-chain only"*, which was simply wrong about the
vendor actually in use: **LI.FI is a bridge aggregator spanning 72 chains**, so the
rail had been restricted to a fraction of what it can do. 0x's Swap API really does
settle on one chain, so the refusal now belongs to the adapter that needs it
(`:cross-chain? false`) instead of to everyone.

Verified live: Ethereum USDC → Base USDC, `100` in and `99.737` out, min-out
extracted and `swap.core/check` passing.

The plan includes an `:erc20-approve` step **only when the response says the
allowance is actually short** (an unconditional approve costs the user a
transaction they may not need; skipping a needed one makes the swap revert). The
comparison is exact decimal-string arithmetic — a double would corrupt any
allowance above 2^53.

## Rail 2 — native BTC ↔ ETH (`swap.thorchain`)

A swap out of Bitcoin is an **ordinary BTC transfer to a vault address, with a
memo**. No wrapped asset, no custodian, no smart contract on the Bitcoin side
(there is no such thing) — see `kotoba-lang/org-thorchain` for why this is the
only usable native shape.

Two things this driver does that matter:

- **It verifies the returned memo before building any step.** A quote returns
  both the vault address *and* the memo, and the memo says where the output goes
  — so an unverified memo hands a remote server authority over the user's funds.
  A substituted destination, a swapped asset, or a silently dropped affiliate fee
  throws here instead of becoming a transfer.
- **It does not paper over a missing guard.** The memo's `LIM` field *is* this
  rail's on-chain min-out. When the memo carries no limit, `:min-out` is `nil`
  and `check` raises `:missing-min-out` — rather than defaulting to expected-out
  and reporting a guard the network isn't enforcing.

Units are kept explicitly apart: THORChain quotes everything in 1e8 fixed point
regardless of the asset's native decimals, so the quote's 1e8 amount and the
transfer's native amount (satoshis vs **wei**) are different numbers for the same
value.

`preflight` additionally flags a halted chain (a halted chain still publishes a
vault address — paying it means waiting for the halt to lift, or a refund), an
amount at/below the dust threshold, and an amount below the node's recommended
minimum (where fixed outbound fees eat a large fraction of the swap).

## Execution

```clojure
(require '[swap.core :as swap])

(def i (swap/intent {:from usdc :to weth :amount "1.5" :taker addr
                     :slippage-bps 100 :fee-bps 30 :fee-recipient treasury-addr}))

(def q (agg/parse-quote i adapter body req))
(swap/check i q now)                    ;=> {:ok? true} | {:ok? false :problems [...]}

(loop [s (swap/begin i q)]
  (if-let [step (swap/current-step s)]
    (let [tx-id (execute! step)]        ; ← your key lives here, not in this library
      (recur (-> s (swap/advance {:event :submitted :tx-id tx-id})
                   (swap/advance {:event :confirmed :tx-id tx-id}))))
    s))
```

`advance` is pure and terminal states are absorbing: a late confirmation can't
resurrect a finished swap, though it is still recorded — `:events` is the audit
trail.

## Verification

```bash
clojure -M:test    # JVM  — 47 tests, 128 assertions
clojure -M:lint    # 0 errors, 0 warnings
# cljs (same suite; nbb doesn't read deps.edn, so assemble the classpath):
nbb --classpath "$(clojure -Spath -M:test | tr ':' '\n' \
     | grep -E 'kotoba-lang|^src$|^test$' | tr '\n' ':')" bin/run_tests.cljs
```

Both rails are driven with response **fixtures**, not live vendors. The tests are
mostly adversarial: substituted destination, dropped fee, inflated fee, a vendor
field rename, an off-by-one allowance, a min-out that ignores the caller's
slippage, an expired quote, a late confirmation after failure.

`bin/verify_live.cljs` then checks the parts fixtures cannot (15/15 as of
2026-07-26, keyless):

- a **live LI.FI quote** end to end — adapter mapping, expected-out, min-out, a
  built transaction step, and `swap.core/check` passing;
- `erc20` against **deployed USDC on Ethereum mainnet** — `decimals`/`symbol`/
  `name`/`balanceOf`/`nonces` calldata and decoders, and the one that matters most:
  a **locally built EIP-712 domain separator equal to USDC's on-chain
  `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR()`**, with the wrong `version` correctly *not* matching. A
  mismatch there means every permit signature is silently rejected on-chain;
- an **EIP-1559 transaction validated by a real Sepolia node** — signed from an
  empty throwaway key, so the node's `insufficient funds` reply is the precise
  discriminator: to produce it, it had to RLP-decode the typed envelope, recover
  the secp256k1 signature, and derive the sender. A malformed envelope or bad
  signature fails earlier and differently.

**The THORChain rail is not live-verified.** Its public endpoints sit behind
Cloudflare bot protection (`thornode.thorswap.net` answers a `Just a moment…`
interstitial; `thornode.ninerealms.com` no longer resolves at all), and working
around bot protection is not something this repo will do. Parts 1–2 of the script
are written and left in place so they run unchanged against your own node — which
is what `org-thorchain` tells you to point at anyway.

## Dependencies

`erc20` (calldata + exact decimal units), `org-thorchain` (memo grammar + quote
verification), `treasury` (fee ledger). No HTTP client, no key handling, no
signing — those belong to `eth-crypto` / `btc-crypto` / `wallet` and the executor.
